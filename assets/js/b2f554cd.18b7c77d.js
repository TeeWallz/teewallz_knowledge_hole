A \'reaching out into the void\'..ness.\\nCovid has made me realised just how connected we all are, and that locking ourselves away and not reaching out into the vastness of humanity is a death sentence.\\nScrolling through endless Facebook/Reddit/Tik Tok algorithms away from the vast gardens of human creation.\\n\\nAfter my ADHD diagnosis, the resulting medication and moving from Australia to Poland, I have finally felt that I can create for creations sake.\\nI have endured through childhood abuse, ADHD, hating myself, depression and this will be a tool to prove to myself that I have worth.\\n\\nThis is my Garden."}]}')}}]);
