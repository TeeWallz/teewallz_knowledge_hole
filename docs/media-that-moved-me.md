An outstanding art piece from a Montreal-based polish artist U M A M I.
A film following Henryk, a man that doesn't age and a supernatural clown, Mischief looking for Henryk's great-grand daughter.
An experience of introspection through a blast of bizarre visuals and horrifying sounds.
Despite the supernatural tone and rough art style, not once was my immersion broken. Truly spectacular.
This as got to have been the best piece of art I have watched in 2022 and would highly recommend.
